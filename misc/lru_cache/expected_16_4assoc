Commands available:
I ptr value - cache the memory location `ptr` storing the value `value`
U ptr value - update the already cached memory location `ptr` to store the value `value`
G ptr - find out if memory location `ptr` is cached, and if it is, return the value stored
P - print cache contents
Q - quit
Note: Please use integer values only. Memory locations should be entered using hexadecimal notation
