This is a simulation of a router's forwarding table.
The commands available are:
D ip - Set the default gateway to `ip`. This should be the first step before any other query
I ip/mask destination - Insert a new entry for the CIDR-ized address ip/mask to be forwarded to `destination`
                        Example: I 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.1.254 will forward 192.168.1.0/24 to the router 192.168.1.254
L ip - Find the next hop for a packet with the destination `ip`. As usual, longest prefix matching is used.
P - Print the routing table
Q - quit
